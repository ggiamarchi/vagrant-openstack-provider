    errors:
      create_bad_state: |-
        While creating the server, it transitioned to an unexpected
        state: '%{state}', instead of properly booting. Run `vagrant status`
        to find out what can be done about this state, or `vagrant destroy`
        if you want to start over.
      no_matching_flavor: |-
        No matching flavor was found! Please check your flavor setting
        to make sure you have a valid flavor chosen.

        make sure you have a valid image chosen.
      sync_method_error: |-
        Value '%{sync_method_value}' is not allowed for 'sync_method' configuration parameter. Valid values are 'rsync' and 'none'
      rsync_error: |-

        Error: %{stderr}
      ssh_unavailble: |-
        SSH server anavailable on instance %{host}. You should maybe increase the timeout value which currently is %{timeout} second(s).

    states:
      short_active: |-
        active
      long_active: |-
        The server is up and running. Run `vagrant ssh` to access it.
      short_build: |-
        building
      long_build: |-
        The server is currently being built. You must wait for this to
        complete before you can access it. You can delete the server, however,
        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error
      long_error: |-
        The server is in an erroneous state. Contact your OpenStack administrator
        or destroy the machine with `vagrant destroy`.
      short_hard_reboot: |-
        hard reboot
      long_hard_reboot: |-
        The server is hard rebooting. This is equivalent to pulling the power plug
        on a physical server, plugging it back in, and rebooting it.
      short_password: |-
        password reset
      long_password: |-
        The password is being reset on the server.
      short_reboot: |-
        reboot
      long_reboot: |-
        The server is in a soft reboot state. A reboot command was passed to the operating system.
      short_rebuild: |-
        rebuild
      long_rebuild: |-
        The server is currently being rebuilt from an image.
      short_rescue: |-
        rescue
      long_rescue: |-
        The server is in rescue mode.
      short_resize: |-
        resize
      long_resize: |-
         Server is performing the differential copy of data that changed during
         its initial copy. Server is down for this stage.
      short_revert_resize: |-
        revert resize
      long_revert_resize: |-
        The resize or migration of a server failed for some reason. The destination
        server is being cleaned up and the original source server is restarting.
      short_shutoff: |-
        shutoff
      long_shutoff: |-
        The virtual machine (VM) was powered down by the user, but not through the
        OpenStack Compute API. For example, the user issued a shutdown -h command
        from within the server instance. If the OpenStack Compute manager detects
        that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server instance to the
        SHUTOFF status. If you use the OpenStack Compute API to restart the instance,
        the instance might be deleted first, depending on the value in the
        shutdown_terminate database field on the Instance model.
      short_suspended: |-
        suspended
      long_suspended: |-
        The server is suspended, either by request or necessity. This status appears
        for only the following hypervisors: XenServer/XCP, KVM, and ESXi.
      short_unknown: |-
        unknown
      long_unknown: |-
        The state of the server is unknown. Contact your cloud provider.
      short_verify_resize: |-
        verify resize
      long_verifiy_resize: |-
        System is awaiting confirmation that the server is operational after a move or resize.
      short_not_created: |-
        not created
      long_not_created: |-
