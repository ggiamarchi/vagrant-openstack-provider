      An unknow error happened in Vagrant OpenStack provider

      To easily debug what happened, we recommend to set the environment
      variable VAGRANT_OPENSTACK_LOG to debug

          $ export VAGRANT_OPENSTACK_LOG=debug

      If doing this does not help fixing your issue, there may be a bug
      in the provider. Please submit an issue on Github at
      https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider
      with the stracktrace and the logs.

      We are looking for feedback, so feel free to ask questions or
      describe features you would like to see in this provider.

    warn_networks: |-
      Warning! The Openstack provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.

        This can happen when the instance has been deleted via OpenStack APIs or OpenStack
        Dashboard instead of using vagrant commands.
        We recommend using the command `vagrant openstack reset` to reset
        vagrant to a clear state
      stack_not_found: |-
        Heat stack not found
      nerwork_service_unavailable: |-
        Neutron service endpoint is not available, thus there is not way to retrieve
        network id from its name. You have to provide only ids in your Vagrantfile.
      volume_service_unavailable: |-
        Cinder service endpoint is not available, thus there is not way to retrieve
        volume id from its name. You have to provide only ids in your Vagrantfile.

      short_build: |-
        building
      long_build: |-
        The server is currently being built. You must wait for this to
        complete before you can access it. You can delete the server, however,
        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error
      long_error: |-
        The server is in an erroneous state. Contact your OpenStack administrator

      short_hard_reboot: |-
        hard reboot

      long_password: |-
        The password is being reset on the server.
      short_reboot: |-
        reboot
      long_reboot: |-
        The server is in a soft reboot state. A reboot command was passed to the operating system.
      short_rebuild: |-
        rebuild
      long_rebuild: |-

        shutoff
      long_shutoff: |-
        The virtual machine (VM) was powered down by the user, but not through the
        OpenStack Compute API. For example, the user issued a shutdown -h command
        from within the server instance. If the OpenStack Compute manager detects
        that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server instance to the
        SHUTOFF status. If you use the OpenStack Compute API to restart the instance,
        the instance might be deleted first, depending on the value in the
        shutdown_terminate database field on the Instance model.
      short_suspended: |-
