      An unknown error happened in Vagrant OpenStack provider

      To easily debug what happened, we recommend to set the environment
      variable VAGRANT_OPENSTACK_LOG to debug

          $ export VAGRANT_OPENSTACK_LOG=debug

      If doing this does not help fixing your issue, there may be a bug
      in the provider. Please submit an issue on Github at
      https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider
      with the stracktrace and the logs.

      We are looking for feedback, so feel free to ask questions or
      describe features you would like to see in this provider.
    version_outdated: |-
      You're not using the latest version of the 'vagrant-openstack-provider' plugin.

      will be silently ignored.

      invalid_stack: |-
        One of the stacks in the stacks provider configuration is invalid
        The configuration option should have the following format:

      keypair_name_required: |-
        Warning! You have specified ssh.private_key_path in your Vagrant configuration.
        but nor keypair_name neither public_key_path are present. The OpenStack provider
        will automatically generate a new keypair and your configuration option
        ssh.private_key_path will be overriden
      private_key_missing: |-
        config.ssh.private_key_path is required when either keypair_name or

        vagrant standard configuration option `ssh.username` is required
      ssh_timeout_deprecated: |-

      sync_folders_deprecated: |-
        The following configuration settings are deprecated and should be
        removed: rsync_includes, rsync_ignore_files, sync_method. Using these

        folder implementation instead of using standard Vagrant synced folders.

        This can happen when the instance has been deleted via OpenStack APIs or OpenStack
        Dashboard instead of using vagrant commands.

        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error

        from within the server instance. If the OpenStack Compute manager detects
        that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server instance to the
        SHUTOFF status. If you use the OpenStack Compute API to restart the instance,
        the instance might be deleted first, depending on the value in the
        shutdown_terminate database field on the Instance model.
      short_suspended: |-
